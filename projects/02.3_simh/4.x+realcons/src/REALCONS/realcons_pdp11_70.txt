INTRODUCTION
The PDP-11/70 Console, drawing D-CS-54-11294-0-1, allows direct control of the
KB11-C computer system. The Console is used for starting, stopping, resetting
and debugging. Its power switch may be used as the master switch for a system.
Indicator lights and the other switches provide facilities for monitoring,
system control and maintenance operations, during which the KB11-C can be made
to execeute single instructions or single Unibus or Memory cycles. The contents
of any memory location or of any register can be examined, and data can be
entered manually from the switches.

Chapter 1 describes the various components of the Console and their use; Chapter
2 describes the logic that controls Console operations.

CHAPTER 1 SWITCHES, INDICATORS AND OPERATION

1.1 OPERATIONAL SWITCHES

1.1.1 Power and Lamp Test Switches
The POWER switch is a three-position, key-operated switch.

OFF - Causes power to be removed from the switched outlets of the Power
      Controller.  Renders the system inoperative.

POWER - Power is applied to the system. All switches are operational.

LOCK - Same as POWER, except that the LOAD ADRS, EXAM, DEP, CONT, ENABLE/HALT, S
       INST/S BUS CYCLE and START switches are disabled. All other switches are
       operational.

The LAMP TEST switch is the white switch between Switch Register 0 and LOAD
ADRS. When raised, it turns all the indicators on. It is used for maintenance.

1.1.2 LOAD ADRS Switch
The LOAD ADRS switch is a momentary action switch. When this switch is
depressed, bits 21 - 16 of the Switch Register are loaded into SCCK SWR(21:16) B
(1) H, and bits 15 - 00 into the PCA and the SR. The address displayed in the
ADDRESS display indicators is a function of the ADDRESS SELECT switch (Paragraph
1.2.1 below).

1.1.3 EXAM Switch
The EXAM(ine) switch is a momentary action switch. When it is depressed, the
contents of the location specified by the ADDRESS display is shown by the DATA
indicators, if the DATA SELECT switch is in the DATA PATHS position.
The ADDRESS display shows either a virtual or a physical address, as determined
by the ADDRESS SELECT switch. Refer to Paragraph 1.2.1

1.1.4 DEP Switch
The DEP(osit) switch is a momentary action switch. When it is raised, the
contents of bits 15 - 00 of the Switch Register are written into the location
specified by the physical address generated by the last LOAD ADRS operation. The
data written is shown by the DATA indicators if the DATA SELECT switch is in the
DATA PATHS position.

The ADDRESS display shows either a virtual or a physical address, as determined
by the ADDRESS SELECT switch, Refer to Paragraph 1.2.1

1.1.5 Step Operations
If several consecutive EXAM operations are performed, the address is incremented
by 2 for each operation after the first one. Thus, it is possible to examine a
series of consecutive word addresses without doing a LOAD ADRS for each EXAM.

In the same manner, it is possible to execute a series of DEP operations without
doing a LOAD ADRS for each one.

The following sequence illustrates these operations

   Operation           Location Shown in
(Activate Switch)      ADDRESS Display
LOAD ADRS                   X
EXAM                        X
DEP                         X
EXAM                        X
EXAM                       X+2
    (Result is EXAM - STEP)
DEP                        X+2
EXAM                       X+2


1.1.6 CONT Switch
The CONT(inue) switch is a momentary action switch whose action depends upon the
position of the HALT/ENABLE switch:

ENABLE - Resumes program execution at the point where it was stopped by the HALT
         switch or by a HALT instruction.

HALT - Used in conjunction with the S INST/S BUS CYCLE switch. See Paragraph
         1.1.8.

The CONT switch has the same effect as the Maintenance Module Stepper Switch,
XMAA S4, when executing single ROM cycles or UPB stops, but not when executing
single clock cycles.

1.1.7 ENABLE/HALT Switch
The ENABLE/HALT switch is a two-position switch:

ENABLE - Used in conjunction with the START or CONT switches, allows program
         execution.
HALT - Stops program execution.

1.1.8 S INST/S BUS CYCLE Switch
The S(ingle) INST(ruction)/S(ingle) BUS CYCLE switch is used in conjunction with
the CONT switch when the HALT/ENABLE switch is in the HALT position:

S INST - When CONT is depressed, a single instruction is executed and the
          processor stops in CON.00. EXAM and DEP operations may then be
          executed. The contents of the DATA Display indicators may only be
          determined by examination of the microprogram Flows for the
          instruction that hasjust been executed.

S BUS CYCLE - When CONT is depressed, execution is resumed but stops in T5 of
          PAUSE of the first Unibus or Memory cycle to be executed.
          The ADDRESS display then contains the address of the location at which
          the bus cycle was performed (virtual or physical, depending on the
          position of the ADDRESS SELECT switch).

          If the DATA SELECT switch is selecting BUS REG (Bus Register), the
          DATA display lights, on a read operation, will contain the data that
          was read (this could be an instruc-tion or data). During a write
          operation, the lights will contain the data just written (except
          during a stack operation or Floating Point in-struction). LOAD ADRS,
          EXAM and DEP are disabled in this mode. If an EXAM or DEP operation is
          desired, the S INST/S BUS CYCLE switch should be changed to S INST and
          the CONT switch should be depressed once. (This will cause execution
          until the end of the current instruction). The system will then be
          ready to perform an EXAM or DEP.

The switch has no effect when the HALT/ENABLE switch is set to ENABLE.

1.1.9 START Switch
The START switch is a momentary action switch whose action depends upon the
setting of the HALT/ENABLE switch:

ENABLE - Starts program execution at the address previously loaded by a LOAD
         ADRS, after resetting the system (INIT).

HALT   - Resets the system.

The START switch has no effect when the processor is in the RUN state.

1.1.10 Switch Register
The Switch Register consists of the 22 switches labeled 0 through 21. These
numbers correspond to the bit positions of their respective switches. The Switch
Register is used to manually enter both addresses and data into the KB11-C, and
its bits, 15 - 00, may be read under program control; its address is 17 777 570.
which is the same as that of the Display Register.

1.2 ADDRESSING AND DATA DISPLAY

1.2.1 ADDRESS SELECT Switch
The ADDRESS SELECT switch is an eight-position rotary switch:

VIRTUAL - Six positions: KERNEL, SUPER and USER I space and KERNEL, SUPER and
          USER D space. The address displayed is a 16-bit virtual address; bits
          21 -16 are always off. During Console DEP or EXAM operations, bits
          15:00 of the Switch Register are considered to be a Virtual Address.
          If Memory Management is enabled, this Virtual Address is relocated.
          The set of PAR/PDRs indicated by the switch position is used.

CONS PHY - (Console Physical). The 22-bit address entered by a LOAD ADRS is the
          physical address of the Console operation.

PROG PHY - (Program Physical). Displays the 22-bit physical address generated by
          Memory Management for the current Unibus or Memory cycle.

The ADDRESS SELECT switch indicator lights are driven directly by the switch.

Refer to Paragraph 1.4 which explains the use of the ADDRESS SELECT switch.

1.2.2 ADDRESS Display Indicators
The ADDRESS display indicators show the address of the data deposited or being
examined. The address is interpreted as a virtual or physical address in
accordance with the position of the ADDRESS SELECT switch. (Paragraph 1.2.1
below).

1.2.3 DATA SELECT Switch
The DATA SELECT switch is a four-position rotary switch:

DATA PATHS - Displays the output of the Shifter. This position is the normal
          display mode, and is used to show the data examined or deposited by
          Console operations.

BUS REG - Displays the output of the Bus Register (BR).

uADRS FPP/CPU - Bits 15 - 08 display the current address of the Floating Point
          Processor microprogram ROM.
          Bits 07 - 00 display the current address of the processor microprogram
          ROM.

DISPLAY REGISTER - Displays the contents of the Light Register. The LR may be
          written into by using address 17 777 570, which is the same as that of
          the Switch Register.

1.2.4 DATA Display Indicators
The DATA indicators display the output of the Data Display Multiplexer. The
output of the multi-plexer is selected by the DATA SELECT switch. Refer to
Paragraph 1.2.3.

1.2.5 PARITY Indicators
The PARITY indicators display the parity bits associated with the HIGH and LOW
bytes of the word read from Cache Memory. These indicators are off during at
write operation.

1.3 EXECUTION INDICATORS

1.3.1 PAR ERR Indicator
The PAR(ity) ERR(or) indicator is on when a Unibus or a memory parity error is
flagged.

1.3.2 ADRS ERR Indicator
The ADRS (Address) ERR (Error) indicator is on when an addressing error occurs.
Address errors are: non-existent memorya access control violation, page length
error, Stack Limit Red, odd address error and Unibus Timeout. This is a dynamic
indication of address errors that occur during program execution. It is a static
indication during Console functions (i.e., EXAM or DEP).

1.3.3 RUN Indicator
The RUN indicator is on when the processor is executing instructions, but is off
during Pause cycles. The RUN indicator is on during a WAIT instruction.

1.3.4 PAUSE Indicator
The PAUSE indicator is on during all Bus Pause and Interrupt Pause cycles,
indicating that the processor is waiting for either Memory or a Unibus device.

1.3.5 MASTER Indicator
The MASTER indicator is on either when the processor is Unibus master (UBCA
CPBSY) or during Console operations [TMCA CONF (1)L asserted].

1.3.6 KERNEL, SUPER, USER Indicators
The KERNEL, SUPER and USER indicators show the actual mode in which the
processor is operating during each cycle. Refer to Section IV of this manual
(Memory Management).

1.3.7 ADDRESSING (Mapping) Indicators
The 16-, 18-, and 22-bit indicators show the Memory Management mapping that is
being used during each cycle.

1.3.8 DATA (Space) Indicator
The DATA indicator shows whether I or D space is used during each cycle. It is
on when D space is used and off when I space is used.

1.4 USAGE

1.4.1 Memory Reference
Memory references from the Console may be either mapped (i.e., using a virtual
address) or unmapped (using a physical address), when Memory Management is
enabled. Mapped references are possible only when Memory Management is enabled.

1.4.1.1 Unmapped Reference
1.  Set the ADDRESS SELECT switch to CONS PHYS.
2.  Enter the 22-bit physical address into the Switch Register.
3.  Depress the LOAD ADRS switch. The physical address in shown by the ADDRESS
    display.
4.  Set the DATA SELECT switch to DATA PATHS.
5a. If the EXAM switch is depressed, the contents of the physical memory
    location entered by the LOAD ADRS operation is displayed by the DATA
    indicators.
5b. If the DEP switch is raised, the contents of bits 15 - 00 of the Switch
    Register are written into the physical memory location entered by the LOAD
    ADRS operation. This same data is displayed by the DATA indicators.

1.4.1.2 Mapped Reference
1.  Set the ADDRESS SELECT switch to one of the virtual positions (refer to
    Paragraph 1.2.1).
2.  Enter the 16-bit virtual address into the Switch Register.
3.  Depress the LOAD ADRS switch. The virtual address is shown by the ADDRESS
    display. Bits 21 - 16 are off.
4.  Set the DATA SELECT switch to DATA PATHS.
5a. If the EXAM switch is depressed, the virtual address loaded by the LOAD ADRS
    operation is relocated by Memory Management. Memory Management (if it is
    enabled) uses the mapping shown by the ADDRESSING indicators (Paragraph
    1.3.8) and the PAR/PDR pair is selected by the ADDRESS SELECT switch. The
    contents of this address are read and displayed by the DATA indicators.
5b. If the DEP switch is raised, the virtual address is relocated as in the EXAM
    operation. The contents of the Switch Register are written into the physical
    memory location pointed to by the physical address. The new contents of this
    location are displayed by the DATA indicators.
6.  If the ADDRESS SELECT switch is now turned to PROG PHY, the physical address
    corresponding to the virtual address used during the EXAM or DEP operation
    is displayed by the ADDRESS indicators.

1.4.2 General Register Reference
EXAM and DEP references to the processor General Registers may be executed by
entering the address of the register (see Table 1-1) into the SWITCH REGISTER,
depressing LOAD ADRS, and then EXAM or DEP, as required. The ADDRESS SELECT
switch setting is ignored; mapping to a General Register is not possible.

EXAM-STEP and DEP-STEP operations can be performed on the General Registers, in
a manner similar to that for memory locations, except that:
1. ADDRESS display is incremented by 1 (instead of 2).
2. The STEP after address 17 777 717 is 17 777 700, such that the addresses are
   looped.
3. It is not possible to STEP up to the first General Register (17 777 700) from
   17 777 676.
